# UART
ðŸ“Œ # Overview

This repository contains the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design of a digital hardware project implemented in Verilog HDL. The design follows a structured approach with datapath and controller separation, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of testing.

âš¡ Features

âœ… Synthesizable Verilog code

âœ… Modular design (Datapath + Control)

âœ… Finite State Machine (FSM) based control logic

âœ… Testbench with simulation waveforms

âœ… Targeted for FPGA (e.g., Xilinx Basys3, Altera, etc.)

âœ… Well-commented and clean RTL code

ðŸ“‚ src/        -> RTL source files (Verilog)
ðŸ“‚ tb/         -> Testbench files
ðŸ“‚ sim/        -> Simulation outputs (waveforms, logs)
ðŸ“‚ docs/       -> Documentation (block diagrams, notes)

ðŸ§ª # Simulation & Verification

Testbenches provided for functional verification.

Can be simulated using ModelSim / Vivado / Icarus Verilog + GTKWave.

Covers normal, boundary, and edge cases to ensure correctness.

ðŸš€ # Future Scope

FPGA implementation for real-time testing

Performance optimization and pipelining

Adding more configurable features
